## ðŸ§© About the Project
This project is designed to streamline the workflow of a car workshop.  
It allows an admin to:
- Register customers and their cars
- Assign service jobs to mechanics
- Manage service history and payments
- Generate receipts through the GUI

The application was originally **console-based** and later expanded into a **Java Swing GUI** using `CardLayout` for a seamless multi-panel navigation experience.
